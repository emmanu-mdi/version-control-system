## Version Control System

This is a JetBrains project of the Kotlin basics track to learn how to track changes of files.

### About
The ability to roll back to the previous versions is crucial for software development. In this project, you will get acquainted with the idea of version control and write a simple version control system.

### Stages
1. **Help page** -> Create a simple interface with a help page and a list of commands.
2. **Add & config** -> Add first commands to your VCS that will allow you to add new files.
3. **Log & commit** -> Continue implementing new commands to save file changes and log the results.
4. **Checkout time** -> Add the last command to switch between commits and retrieve the file contents.
